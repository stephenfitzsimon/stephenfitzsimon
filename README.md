Welcome to my profile!</br>
I hope it's a fun file;</br>
    My type of lunch</br>
    Is data to crunch,</br>
'Cuz numbers are always in style.</br>

## Intro
I am a Data Scienctist and problem solver.  I am like to work on projects that explore the things I'm interested in: math, langauges, economics, and the environment.  I like to explore problems in language and mathematics, and share what I learn with others. In my free time I enjoy studying linguistics, writing and reading.  If you like my work please reach out to me!  Check out my linkedin profile for more information.

## Projects I'm Proud Of:
- <a href='https://github.com/stephenfitzsimon/possum-regression/blob/main/possum_models.ipynb'>Possum Regression and Classification`possum_model.ipynb`</a>: Predicting the sex and age of the Short-eared/Mountain-Brushtail possum of Australia. A classification model is 0.97 accurate and an age model predicts with an error of 0.5 year.
- <a href="https://github.com/stephenfitzsimon/pet_adoption_project">Pet Outcomes `pet_adoption_project`</a> : Analyzed pet intake and outcome data at Austin Animal Center to predict animal outcomes to discover drivers of adoption.
- <a href="https://github.com/stephenfitzsimon/zillow_regression_project">Zillow Price Prediction `zillow_regression_project`</a>: Analyzed a limited set of real estate data for southern California, and applied a basic linear regression model. Learned about linear regression models with `sklearn`, model metrics with `sklearn`, and visualization in `seaborn`.
- <a href= "https://github.com/stephenfitzsimon/zillow_clustering_project">Zillow LogError Prediction `zillow_clustering_project`</a>: Analyzed Zillow data to determine drivers of logerror.  Used clustering algorithm machine learning to determine patterns in data. Learned about clustering modeling with `sklearn`, statistical analysis with `scipy`, and visualizing data with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- <a href="https://github.com/stephenfitzsimon/weathercli_realpython">Weather CLI `weathercli_realpython`</a>: Followed the RealPython tutorial to build a command line application to show current weather for a user specified city.  Learned about `argparse`, API calls, and INI files.

#### Languages I'm learning
- Python
- Java
- SQL
- HTML/CSS/PHP
