Welcome to my profile!</br>
I hope it's a fun file;</br>
    My type of lunch</br>
    Is data to crunch,</br>
'Cuz numbers are always in style.</br>
</p>

## Intro
I am a student at CodeUp learning Data Science in the Jemison cohort.  I am Looking forward to working on projects that explore the things I'm interested in: math, langauges, economics, and the environment.  I like to explore problems in language and mathematics, and share what I learn with others. In my free time I enjoy studying linguistics, writing and reading.

"Tell all the truth but tell it slant —<br>
Success in Circuit lies<br>
Too bright for our infirm Delight<br>
The Truth's superb surprise<br>
As Lightning to the Children eased<br>
With explanation kind<br>
The Truth must dazzle gradually<br>
Or every man be blind —" <br>
-Emily Dickinson

## What I'm Working On:
- <a href='https://github.com/stephenfitzsimon/possum-regression'>Possum Regression and Classification</a>: Predicting the sex and age of the Short-eared/Mountain-Brushtail possum of Australia.

## Projects I'm Proud Of:
- <a href="https://github.com/stephenfitzsimon/zillow_regression_project">Zillow Price Prediction `zillow_regression_project`</a>: Analyzed a limited set of real estate data for southern California, and applied a basic linear regression model. Learned about linear regression models with `sklearn`, model metrics with `sklearn`, and visualization in `seaborn`.
- <a href= "https://github.com/stephenfitzsimon/zillow_clustering_project">Zillow LogError Prediction `zillow_clustering_project`</a>: Analyzed Zillow data to determine drivers of logerror.  Used clustering algorithm machine learning to determine patterns in data. Learned about clustering modeling with `sklearn`, statistical analysis with `scipy`, and visualizing data with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- <a href="https://github.com/stephenfitzsimon/weathercli_realpython">Weather CLI `weathercli_realpython`</a>: Followed the RealPython tutorial to build a command line application to show current weather for a user specified city.  Learned about `argparse`, API calls, and INI files.

#### Languages I'm learning
- Python
- Java
- SQL
- HTML/CSS/PHP
