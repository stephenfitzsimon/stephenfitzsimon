Welcome to my profile!</br>
I hope it's a fun file;</br>
    My type of lunch</br>
    Is data to crunch,</br>
'Cuz numbers are always in style.</br>
</p>

## Intro
I am a student at CodeUp learning Data Science in the Jemison cohort.  I am Looking forward to working on projects that explore the things I'm interested in: math, langauges, economics, and the environment.  I like to explore problems in language and mathematics, and share what I learn with others. In my free time I enjoy studying linguistics, writing and reading.

"Our revels now are ended. These our actors,<br>
As I foretold you, were all spirits, and<br>
Are melted into air, into thin air;<br>
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,<br>
The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,<br>
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,<br>
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,<br>
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,<br>
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff<br>
As dreams are made on; and our little life<br>
Is rounded with a sleep." <br>
-Shakespeare, The Tempest

#### Languages I'm learning
