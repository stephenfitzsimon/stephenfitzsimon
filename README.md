Welcome to my profile!</br>
I hope it's a fun file;</br>
    My type of lunch</br>
    Is data to crunch,</br>
'Cuz numbers are always in style.</br>
</p>

## Intro
I am a student at CodeUp learning Data Science in the Jemison cohort.  I am Looking forward to working on projects that explore the things I'm interested in: math, langauges, economics, and the environment.  I like to explore problems in language and mathematics, and share what I learn with others. In my free time I enjoy studying linguistics, writing and reading.

"Tell all the truth but tell it slant —<br>
Success in Circuit lies<br>
Too bright for our infirm Delight<br>
The Truth's superb surprise<br>
As Lightning to the Children eased<br>
With explanation kind<br>
The Truth must dazzle gradually<br>
Or every man be blind —" <br>
-Emily Dickinson

## Projects I'm Proud Of:
- Telco Churn Classification project `telco_churn_classification`: Analyzed data to determine variables that lead to customer churn, and built a classification model in order to predict churn with 0.77 accuracy.
- Weather CLI `weathercli_realpython`: Followed the RealPython tutorial to build a command line application to show current weather for a user specified city.  Learned about `argparse`, API calls, and INI files.

#### Languages I'm learning
- Python
- Java
- SQL
- HTML/CSS/PHP
