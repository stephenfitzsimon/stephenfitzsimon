## Intro
I am a student at CodeUp learning Data Science in the Jemison cohort.

"Tell all the truth but tell it slant —<br>
Success in Circuit lies<br>
Too bright for our infirm Delight<br>
The Truth's superb surprise<br>
As Lightning to the Children eased<br>
With explanation kind<br>
The Truth must dazzle gradually<br>
Or every man be blind —" <br>
-Emily Dickinson
