Welcome to my profile!</br>
I hope it's a fun file;</br>
    My type of lunch</br>
    Is data to crunch,</br>
'Cuz numbers are always in style.</br>

## About Me
I am an data scientist, coder, and problem solver. My math background allows me to think analytically about problems; my computer background allows me to implement effective solutions; and my language background allows me to communicate solutions to others. I'm always eager to learn from others, and help others learn!

My skills are in programming, data analysis, and multiple languages (computer and human). I have experience with Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and C++.

## Projects I'm Proud Of:
- <a href='https://github.com/stephenfitzsimon/possum-regression/blob/main/possum_models.ipynb'>Possum Regression and Classification`possum_model.ipynb`</a>: Predicting the sex and age of the Short-eared/Mountain-Brushtail possum of Australia. A classification model is 0.97 accurate and an age model predicts with an error of 0.5 year.
- <a href="https://github.com/stephenfitzsimon/pet_adoption_project">Pet Outcomes `pet_adoption_project`</a> : Analyzed pet intake and outcome data at Austin Animal Center to predict animal outcomes to discover drivers of adoption.
- <a href="https://github.com/stephenfitzsimon/zillow_regression_project">Zillow Price Prediction `zillow_regression_project`</a>: Analyzed a limited set of real estate data for southern California, and applied a basic linear regression model. Learned about linear regression models with `sklearn`, model metrics with `sklearn`, and visualization in `seaborn`.
- <a href= "https://github.com/stephenfitzsimon/zillow_clustering_project">Zillow LogError Prediction `zillow_clustering_project`</a>: Analyzed Zillow data to determine drivers of logerror.  Used clustering algorithm machine learning to determine patterns in data. Learned about clustering modeling with `sklearn`, statistical analysis with `scipy`, and visualizing data with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- <a href="https://github.com/stephenfitzsimon/weathercli_realpython">Weather CLI `weathercli_realpython`</a>: Followed the RealPython tutorial to build a command line application to show current weather for a user specified city.  Learned about `argparse`, API calls, and INI files.

#### Languages I'm learning
- Python
- Java
- SQL
- HTML/CSS/PHP
